1.1.6.5
KSP-AVC/AddonInfo

	Add code to ensure that the Min/max are both there, and that they override the KSPVersion if it is there
		Added Min/Max functions to VersionInfo
		Added FixMissingMinMax after parsing files

		if KSP_VERSION is outside the bounds of KSP_VERSION_MIN and KSP_VERSION_MAX, it will be replaced with the appropriate one.  
		If only one of the KSP_VERSION_MIN and KSP_VERSION_MAX are specified and KSP_VERSION is specified, then the missing parameter 
		will be set to either the appropriate min/max against  KSP_VERSION

	Disabled the remote overriding local if the versions were identical
