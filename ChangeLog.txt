KSP-AVC/AddonInfo

	Add code to ensure that the Min/max are both there, and that they override the KSPVersion if it is there
		Added Min/Max functions to VersionIfno
		Added FixMissingMinMax after parsing files

		if KSP_VERSION is outside the bounds of KSP_VERSION_MIN and KSP_VERSION_MAX, it will be replaced with the appropriate one.  
		If only one of the KSP_VERSION_MIN and KSP_VERSION_MAX are specified and KSP_VERSION is specified, then the missing parameter 
		will be set to either the appropriate min/max against  KSP_VERSION

	Disabled the remote overriding local if the versions were identical

	Added some messages to indicate what sort of error occurred

	Updated the "built for" message to be either a single version or a range of versions

For all the following, VERSION < remote VERSION.  The following cases  should all result in an update available message

	KSP_VERSION only
		KSPActual == remote KSP_VERSION					
	
	KSP_VERSION & KSP_MIN_VERSION
		KSPActual >= remote KSP_MIN_VERSION
		
	KSP_VERSION & KSP_MAX_VERSION
		KSPActual <= remote KSP_MAX_VERSION

	KSP_MIN_VERSION & KSP_MAX_VERSION
		KSPActual >= remote KSP_MIN_VERSION && KSPActual <= remote KSP_MAX_VERSION
